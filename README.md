## Overview
This project creates a neural network trained on a dataset of over 9000 superhero and supervillain names to generate similar names. Using a character-level language model, the network predicts the next character in a given sequence to generate new names.

## Objectives
- Implementing a neural network for sequence prediction
- Training the model on a custom dataset
- Generating new text based on a trained model

## Dataset
The dataset includes over 9000 names of superheroes, supervillains, and other fictional characters.

## Requirements
- Python
- TensorFlow
- matplotlib
- scikit learn
- Google Colab

## Getting Started
1. Open the Google Colab notebook:
   [Link to Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Abdelmalek-Djemaa/Create-a-Superhero-Name-Generator-with-TensorFlow/blob/main/Superhero_Name_Generator_with_TensorFlow.ipynb)

2. Ensure you have the required dataset. You can upload the dataset to Google Colab from the github repo.


## Usage
1. **Prepare Data**:
   - Download the dataset of superhero names and upload it to your Colab environment.
   
2. **Run the Notebook**:
   - Open and run the cells in the Colab notebook. The notebook will:
     - Load and preprocess the dataset
     - Build and train a character-level language model
     - Generate new superhero names based on a seed input

## Results
- Discuss the generated superhero names and insights gained from the model.
- Include examples of generated names and their characteristics.

## Future Improvements
- Potential enhancements or modifications to improve model accuracy or creativity.
- Ideas for expanding the project scope or applying the model to other datasets.
